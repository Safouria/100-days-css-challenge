# Day 2 - Animated Hamburger Menu

This is the **second challenge** of my [100 Days CSS Challenge](https://github.com/Safouria/100-Days-CSS).  
The goal of this day was to create an **animated hamburger menu** that transforms into a close (X) icon with smooth transitions, and back again when clicked.

## 🛠️ Features
- Three lines forming a hamburger menu  
- On click:  
  - Top and bottom lines move and rotate into an **X**  
  - Middle line fades out  
- On second click: animation reverses and lines return to hamburger form  
- Smooth animations using `@keyframes` and `cubic-bezier` easing
